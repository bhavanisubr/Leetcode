/**
 *  Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function 
 *  to compute the researcher's h-index. According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist 
 *  has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no 
 *  more than h citations each."
 *
 *  For example: Given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each 
 *  of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 
 *  3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
 *
 *  Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index. 
 *  Assume that the citations array is sorted in ascending order.
